Kaleidoscope
============

The [LLVM tutorial language Kaleidoscope, OCaml version of the tutorial](https://releases.llvm.org/12.0.1/docs/tutorial/OCamlLangImpl1.html), adapted by me to use `ocamllex` and `ocamlyacc` instead of Stream parsers.

Also adapted for compatibility with `libllvm-3.3-ocaml-dev`.

Currently corresponding to the state at the end of chapter 3 (parser, lexer, and code generation working; no optimization or JITing yet).
